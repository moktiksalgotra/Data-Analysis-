# Sales Data Analysis and Optimization

This project involves a comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) process to improve data quality and extract meaningful insights. The dataset undergoes multiple preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and reliability for further analysis and decision-making.

# Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Identifying and filling missing data using appropriate imputation techniques or removing rows/columns with excessive missing values.
Removing Duplicates: Detecting and eliminating duplicate records to prevent data redundancy.
Handling Negative Values: Addressing invalid negative values in numerical fields such as price and quantity.
2. Outlier Detection and Treatment
Identifying Outliers: Using statistical methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR) and visualization techniques to detect anomalies in data.
Treating Outliers: Applying log transformation and other methods to normalize skewed distributions while preserving data integrity.
Zero Value Handling: Removing or imputing zero values in price and quantity where necessary.
3. Feature Engineering
Creating New Features: Introducing additional columns to enhance analytical insights, such as customer segmentation, sales trends, and transaction behavior.
Extracting Temporal Features: Deriving meaningful time-based features like month, weekday, or seasonal trends to study their impact on sales performance.
4. Data Aggregation and Summarization
Monthly Revenue Analysis: Summarizing sales performance over months to identify trends and seasonality.
Weekday Sales Trends: Analyzing transaction patterns based on days of the week to optimize business operations.
Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on purchase behavior to assess retention and churn rates.
Product Performance: Aggregating data to evaluate top-selling and least-performing products.
Country-Wise Sales Distribution: Understanding regional trends and identifying high-revenue markets.
5. Data Visualization and Insights
Sales Trends Analysis: Examining revenue growth patterns and forecasting potential future performance.
Top Performing Products: Identifying high-demand items to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
Country-Wise Sales Insights: Visualizing sales distribution across different regions to uncover new business opportunities.
Profitability and Churn Analysis: Assessing profit margins and analyzing customer retention rates to improve engagement strategies.
Conclusion
This project provides a structured approach to cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data, enabling data-driven decision-making. The insights extracted help businesses optimize sales strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
